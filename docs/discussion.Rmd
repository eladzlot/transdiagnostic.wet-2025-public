# Discussion

This study suggests that self-guided, future-oriented WET is an effective and scalable intervention for treating transdiagnostic anxiety.
Moreover, it highlights distress tolerance and anxiety levels regarding one's core threat as key mechanisms of change.

## Effectiveness of WET

Recent years have seen a growing interest in evidence-based self-help interventions, including unguided [e.g., @morganEffectivenessUnguidedInternet2017] and guided online treatments [@anderssonInternetdeliveredPsychologicalTreatments2019].
These interventions often achieve effect sizes comparable to face-to-face therapy [@esfandiariInternetDeliveredFacetoFaceCognitive2021].
Our findings contribute to this literature by demonstrating that self-guided, online, future-oriented WET can achieve meaningful improvements.
This raises potential for the incorporation of WET in transdiagnostic or specific online protocols.

In a meta-analysis of online unguided self-help interventions, Wang and colleagues [-@wangSystematicReviewMetaanalysis2023]
reported small effects when treating anxiety ($d = 0.35$, 95% CI [0.22, 0.48]).
Whereas in the current study, WET demonstrated a small effect size compared to waitlist control during treatment ($d = `r mean(delta.treatment.wet - delta.treatment.wl)`$) it developed into a medium effect size at one week follow-up ($d = `r mean(delta.wet/sd.wet - delta.wl/sd.wl)`$) and kept improving  at the two month followup ($`r mean(delta.all.wet - delta.all.wl)`$).
This change corresponds to approximately $`r mean(delta.all.wet*sd.wet)`$ points on the OASIS, which is more than half the reliable change threshold of $4.41$ [@moorePsychometricEvaluationOverall2015].
Alongside the reduction in anxiety, we observed a small but significant improvement in functional impairment, corroborating the clinical relevance of the intervention.
These results suggest that while WET is effective, it should be implemented as part of a broader, multi-component treatment rather than as a stand-alone intervention

Previous research has established WET's efficacy for specific disorders.
For example, Sloan and Marx demonstrated non-inferiority to best-practice treatments for PTSD [@sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2023; @thompson-hollandsBriefNovelTherapies2019].
Similarly, future-oriented WET has shown promise for treating generalized anxiety disorder [@ovanessianPreliminaryTestTherapeutic2019; @goldmanImpactWrittenExposure2007].
Our findings extend these principles to anxiety as a transdiagnostic phenomenon.
Moreover, consistent with previous studies [@sloanBriefExposureBasedTreatment2018; @thompson-hollandsLongtermTreatmentGains2018], we observed continued improvements post-intervention, highlighting WET's potential for sustained effects.
The diversity of our sample and standardized online delivery suggest these findings should generalize well to other populations.
However, our unusually low dropout rates may be influenced by participant compensation, and cultural differences or technology limitations could affect the intervention's effectiveness in other contexts.

The effectiveness of WET supports the notion that writing about one's future threats enables emotional processing.
Furthermore, it highlights that individuals are capable of engaging in this process without the active guidance of a therapist.
Beyond the implications as an inexpensive and accessible intervention, WET provides a scalable method to investigate therapeutic processes in exposure and other interventions.
It offers a relatively simple intervention that can easily be adjusted to emphasize different aspects of the intervention process, such as focusing on the first or third person, varying levels of immersion, or addressing past versus future events.
Additionally, WET generates rich textual data that can offer further insights into the cognitive and emotional dynamics at play during emotional processing
Thus, wet serves as an important tool in the psychotherapy researcher's toolbox.

## Notes on Technique

The WET protocol differs significantly from traditional, future-oriented imaginal exposure flooding methods, introducing both key innovations and trade-offs [see @asnaaniUpdatingWatsonMarks2016].
Traditional imaginal exposure typically involves recording a fixed threat script that patients listen to repeatedly fostering immersion by encouraging patients to close their eyes and focus inward.
In contrast, the WET protocol requires participants to rewrite their threat script each session.
This approach creates an evolving narrative that may facilitate processing of the meanings associated with the threat [see @sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2019].

This approach introduces a tradeoff between immersion and reflective distance.
While traditional imaginal exposure enhances immersion through closing ones' eyes, WET requires writing with ones' eyes open, which may reduce immersion but adds a layer of reflective distance.
To address this, participants were instructed to remain attuned to their emotions and sensations, and if they run out of content, briefly close their eyes to regain immersion.

A unique challenge in imaginal exposure is the difficulty in assessing participants' levels of engagement and immersion.
WET addresses this issue by creating a concrete, written record of participants' thoughts and experiences during exposure.
Clinically, this written documentation provides valuable feedback, allowing therapists to guide participants on specific aspects to enhance (for example, advising them to focus more on physical sensations if needed).
The written records are also useful for research, enabling analysis of factors like exposure duration, narrative detail, and the specific language used to describe the threat.

## NIW as an Intervention

WET did not appear to improve immediate outcomes relative to the control condition.
However, we believe this interpretation misses an important point: NIW showed significant effects, suggesting it may not have been an inert placebo.
Active control conditions in psychological interventions typically demonstrate moderate effects.
For example, research on internet-based interventions for anxiety has shown that active control yield effect sizes around $0.5$, using interventions such as relaxation tasks or forum participation [@newbyInternetbasedCognitiveBehavioral2018; @johanssonTailoredVsStandardized2012; @carlbringIndividuallytailoredInternetbasedTreatment2011].
By contrast, NIW had an absolute effect size of $`r mean(delta.ew/sd.ew)`$ at the one week follow-up.
This suggests that NIW is not simply a placebo.

Several mechanisms may explain NIW’s efficacy.
One possibility is the role of *distancing*, a well-documented emotion regulation strategy [@powersRegulatingEmotionDistancing2019; @krossSelfdistancingTheoryResearch2017].
Writing about non-distressing topics may have helped participants practice disengaging from threatening cognitions, facilitating emotional recovery.
Indeed, such training reduces distress [@dennyBehavioralEffectsLongitudinal2014], and this was the faux rationale given in the psychoeducation section.
Alternatively, having participants evaluate their response to the core threat script twice per session may have served as a form of exposure.
Additionally, NIW scripts often included positive or meditative content, suggesting that mindfulness or positive imagery may have supported the observed benefits [@hofmannEffectMindfulnessBasedTherapy2010; @pileHarnessingEmotionalMental2021].
Similarly, rehearsing positive ideation, even when unrelated to personal worries, has been shown to counteract worry in individuals with generalized anxiety disorder [@eaglesonPowerPositiveThinking2016].

Baseline anxiety levels may have also influenced NIW's effectiveness.
NIW participants began with higher anxiety scores, potentially amplifying improvements.
Greater baseline severity often yields larger gains due to regression to the mean [@barnettRegressionMeanWhat2005] or more accessible pathology [@driessenDoesPretreatmentSeverity2010].
This difference remains a potential confounder despite lacking statistical significance.

NIW shows promise as a therapeutic tool for training distancing, distraction, and disengagement skills.
However, we found contrasting trajectories with WET: NIW produced rapid initial anxiety reduction but plateaued over time, while WET showed slower initial progress but continued steady symptom reduction, ultimately achieving superior long-term effectiveness.
This suggests that NIW may offer immediate symptom relief, while WET provides more sustained benefits.
The small sample size in the NIW condition (29 participants) limits generalizability, emphasizing the need for further research to confirm these effects and determine optimal contexts for each approach.

## How WET Works

The current study aims to advance our understanding of treatment mechanisms by identifying potential mediators.
Mediators are potential pathways linking treatment to outcomes, though not all mediators qualify as true causal mechanisms [@kraemerMediatorsModeratorsTreatment2002].
We surveyed multiple potential processes to identify candidates for change in WET.
Among those that significantly changed—distress tolerance, positive self-schema, perceived impact of future events, and metacognitive processes—only distress tolerance was significantly correlated with symptom reduction, suggesting it as a key mechanism.
Additionally, change in the anxious response to core threats predicted symptom change.

### Distress Tolerance

Distress tolerance, defined as an individual’s ability to endure negative emotional states [@simonsDistressToleranceScale2005], is increasingly recognized as a transdiagnostic factor  of emotional disorders.
It has been linked to symptom severity and treatment outcome in conditions including depression [@lassDistressToleranceSymptoms2020], anxiety [@michelEmotionalDistressTolerance2016], PTSD [@boffaDistressToleranceMechanism2018], and substance use disorders [@leyroDistressTolerancePsychopathological2010].
Psychotherapies that enhance distress tolerance, such as dialectical behavior therapy, often improve patients’ capacity to engage with distressing emotions, reducing avoidance behaviors and promoting resilience [@leyroDistressTolerancePsychopathological2010].
Indeed, prior research has demonstrated that distress tolerance mediates change in mindfulness-based interventions [@liDistressToleranceMechanism2023; @liDistressToleranceMediator2024].

Our findings suggest that WET fosters distress tolerance presumably by encouraging participants to engage with distressing thoughts and emotions.
While these results support the role of distress tolerance as a mechanism of change in WET, further research is needed to establish a causal connection between changes in DTS and symptom reduction [@kraemerMediatorsModeratorsTreatment2002].
Specifically, longitudinal studies could clarify whether improvements in distress tolerance precede or occur concurrently with symptom changes.

Research suggests specific distress tolerance subtypes (intolerance of uncertainty, anxiety sensitivity) predict change better than general DTS [@michelEmotionalDistressTolerance2016].
This necessitates refining our understanding of how WET influences distress tolerance and its role in symptom reduction.
Future research should explore these subdomains to clarify how WET enhances specific facets of distress tolerance and their contribution to therapeutic outcomes.
A nuanced approach may reveal distinct change pathways, informing tailored interventions that maximize impact across emotional disorders.

### Responses to Core Threats

Central to pathological fear is an inflated sense of threat, making perceived threat reduction key to alleviating anxiety [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Our findings showed WET reduced response to core threats more effectively than NIW.
The rate of threat reduction between sessions one and two predicted symptom improvement by session four, supporting temporal precedence.

Most threat reduction occurred early, with minimal change thereafter despite ongoing symptom improvements.
This suggests repeated threat engagement might work through other mechanisms like distress tolerance, or that there is unique benefit from continued threat activation.
Future research should explore whether improving writing scripts to target "hot spots" could enhance threat reduction across sessions, similar to WET practices for PTSD where scripts are progressively refined [@sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2019].

Emotional engagement seems to be a prime target for improvement.
Focusing on emotional rather than cognitive aspects of writing enhances outcomes in PTSD [@sloanDoesAlteringWriting2007].
Future iterations of WET could deepen emotional processing at each session by explicitly encouraging emotional engagement or enhancing imagery realism [@holmesMentalImageryEmotion2010; @holmesMentalImageryEmotion2005].
Furthermore, improving the threat script by better reflecting the core threat and decreasing avoidance may also be important [@zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].

The distinct threat-response trajectories in WET and NIW illustrate their divergent mechanisms.
In WET, sessions elevated threat-response, but the between-session reduction led to lower overall threat-response.
In contrast, NIW provided short-term threat-response relief with smaller long-term benefits, likely reflecting its strategy of distraction rather than engagement with the core threat.
This highlights the importance of targeting core threats in interventions designed to reduce anxiety.

Changes in both threat response and distress tolerance predicted symptom reduction.
One might hypothesize these processes are related—perhaps decreased threat response results from increased distress tolerance.
However, we found no significant correlation between these variables, suggesting they operate independently.
This distinction highlights two complementary WET mechanisms: distress tolerance as a generic skill applicable across distinct threats, and threat response changes that address specific threats manifesting across various contexts.
Future research should investigate how these processes interact and complement each other to influence treatment outcomes, potentially providing broader insights into therapeutic mechanisms beyond WET.

## Advancing Mechanism-Driven Research with Transdiagnostic WET

This study demonstrated self-guided, online transdiagnostic WET's efficacy, showing superiority over both waitlist and active writing controls.
With just four 20-minute writing sessions, WET achieved large effect sizes at follow-up.
The study identified two potential mechanisms: increased distress tolerance and reduced distress responses to core threats.

As clinical psychology shifts from outcome-focused to hypothesis-driven mechanism research [@hofmannFutureInterventionScience2019], flexible methodologies are increasingly needed.
Transdiagnostic WET meets this need as a concise, self-administered intervention easily delivered online.
Beyond its effectiveness in reducing anxiety and functional impairment, WET's adaptability is its strength.
Its structured yet flexible instructions can be tailored to test various interventions, target different mechanisms, and assess effects across outcomes.
WET enables investigation of both processes and outcomes across diverse populations and settings, advancing mechanism-driven research while offering a scalable, accessible transdiagnostic intervention.
