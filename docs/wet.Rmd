abstract: |
  This study investigates mechanisms underlying Transdiagnostic Written Exposure Therapy (WET), a novel, scalable online intervention for anxiety disorders.
  In a randomized controlled trial with 89 participants, WET produced significant anxiety reduction that continued through two-month follow-up.
  Examining multiple potential mechanisms, we identified two that were both significantly affected by treatment and correlated with symptom improvement: enhanced distress tolerance (r = -0.35) and decreased anxious responses to core threats (r = 0.39).
  This suggests exposure therapy operates through dual pathways: developing adaptive emotional regulation skills while simultaneously recalibrating threat appraisals.
  Neither pathway mediated the other's effects, supporting a dual-process model of exposure.
  Interestingly, a neutral imagery control condition showed immediate but non-sustained anxiety reduction and actually decreased distress tolerance, revealing distinct therapeutic trajectories and mechanisms between distraction-based versus exposure-based interventions.
  This research advances theoretical understanding of therapeutic mechanisms while highlighting specific targets for enhancing interventions.
