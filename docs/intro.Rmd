Written interventions have long been part of the psychological toolbox [@ruiniWritingTechniquePsychotherapies2022].
They have been used both as an aid and as a central technique [@riordanScriptotherapyTherapeuticWriting1996; @smythExpressiveWritingClinical2008].
One such method, expressive writing, is a therapeutic technique in which individuals freely write about emotional or traumatic experiences [@pennebakerWritingEmotionalExperiences1997].
Evidence indicates that general expressive writing has a consistent but limited effect [e.g., @frattaroliExperimentalDisclosureIts2006].
However, there is evidence that expressive writing is highly effective in specific contexts.

Written Exposure Therapy (WET) is a structured, brief intervention designed to treat traumatic experiences of individuals with PTSD through expressive writing.
Originally developed as a focused application of imaginal exposure (IE) for PTSD, WET was created to offer a streamlined, accessible alternative to more traditional therapies.
Studies have shown that WET yields strong effects for PTSD, comparable to established treatments like Cognitive Processing Therapy and Prolonged Exposure [@thompson-hollandsBriefNovelTherapies2019; @sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2019; @sloanWrittenExposureIntervention2012; @sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2023].
While WET has traditionally been applied specifically to PTSD, recent studies have extended its use to generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) by focusing on future-oriented feared outcomes [@goldmanImpactWrittenExposure2007; @ovanessianPreliminaryTestTherapeutic2019] including in an online format [@roch-gagneFeasibilityOpenTrial2019], indicating its potential for broader, transdiagnostic applications.

This paper introduces transdiagnostic WET, a variation of WET tailored for a transdiagnostic population.
Since WET integrates elements of both IE and expressive writing, we address the foundations of each approach to fine-tune transdiagnostic WET.
Two key insights drive the modifications that have been made from past-oriented WET to future-oriented WET: exposure needs to be a) focused and b) immersive.

Meta-analyses have found that more directive instructions yield better outcomes in expressive writing [@frattaroliExperimentalDisclosureIts2006; @reinholdEffectsExpressiveWriting2018].
Indeed, WET for PTSD focuses on the most distressing traumatic event that the client has [@sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2019].
Furthermore, WET has been found to be more effective when focusing on a single fear rather than alternating between different fears, both in GAD and PTSD [@fracalanzaTestingProceduralVariant2014; @sloanFurtherExaminationExposure2005].
When administered for PTSD, WET focuses on the central source of anxiety - the traumatic event - by default .
We propose to improve the focus of WET by explicitly focusing on core threats: the ultimate feared consequence of one's fear or anxiety [@huppertCoreFearsValues2012; @zlotnickAnatomyFearCloser2025].
Clinicians suggest that focusing on core threats in psychological treatments improves efficacy, enhances generalizability, and reduces relapse 
[@foaEmotionalProcessingFear1986; @gillihanCommonPitfallsExposure2012; @murrayDissectingCoreFear2016].
We have developed an online questionnaire to reliably identify core threats [@zlotnickCoreThreatStructured2025].
Thus, to ensure that the intervention is accurately focused, we help participants identify their core threats and then instruct them to focus on these idiosyncratic core threats throughout their writing.

A second set of accommodations to the WET protocol is to help participants create an immersive script.
Building on the work of Lang [-@langImageryTherapyInformation1977], emotional processing theory contends that
emotional activation is necessary for emotional processing to occur [@foaEmotionalProcessingFear1986; @foaEmotionalProcessingTheory2006].
Indeed, IE protocols typically involve conjuring a vivid, detailed image of one's worst case scenario from a first person perspective [e.g., @abramowitzPsychologicalTreatmentObsessive2006; @foaTreatingYourOCD2012].
Furthermore, focusing on the emotional aspects in writing is more beneficial than focusing on cognitive or control conditions [@sloanDoesAlteringWriting2007].
Moreover, individuals undergoing WET show signs of physiological distress, supporting the idea that emotional activation is necessary for successful treatment [@wiscoMechanismsChangeWritten2016].
However, the WET protocol for PTSD emphasizes recounting traumatic experiences from a distancing perspective (e.g., "as you look back upon it now") rather than an immersed perspective [e.g., "as if it were happening right now;" @sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2019].
This approach is based on the idea that a distanced perspective better facilitates "working through" difficult life experiences [e.g., @krossSelfdistancingTheoryResearch2017].
We argue that this approach is appropriate for PTSD, where a major aspect of the intervention is to reconstruct the traumatic narrative.
Indeed, the WET protocol explicitly states this goal: "By repeatedly recounting the event, you will be able to correct for the splintered fashion in which the memory may have been stored." [@sloanWrittenExposureTherapy2019, pp. 53].
We contend that in future-oriented IE for a transdiagnostic, non-traumatized population increased emotional activation is needed.
Thus, we direct participants to immerse themselves in the writing by using first person, providing detailed sensory and emotional descriptions, and periodically closing their eyes and calling upon their imaginations.

The primary goal of this study was to develop and validate the efficacy of future-oriented WET.
However, it is clear that a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of interventions will allow more precise interventions [@nivPrecisionCognitiveBehavioral2021].
Moreover, a holistic theory that integrates their theory is needed [@huppertCBTAnxietyDisorders2020;@brewinTHEORETICALFOUNDATIONSCOGNITIVEBEHAVIOR1996; @hofmannFutureInterventionScience2019].
Thus, we aim to explore several potential mechanisms underlying WET [cf. @rousseauMechanismsActionUnderlying2018].

**1. Fear reduction:**
Early studies suggested that imaginal exposure promotes habituation of pathological anxiety [e.g., @foaHabituationSubjectiveAnxiety1978].
Repeated exposure to the same scenario may lead to fear reduction through habituation—a decreased response to the imagined scenario—or through extinction, wherein the imagined scenario becomes neutral after breaking its association with an aversive stimulus [cf. @cooperEmpiricalReviewPotential2017].
Fear reduction was assessed through self-reported responses to the imagined scenario before and after the intervention, measured both within and across sessions [see @foaEmotionalProcessingFear1986; @ruppEmotionalProcessingTheory2017].

**2. Specific reactions to flashforward images**
While metacognitive beliefs apply to all mental events, specific memories or images may evoke distinct reactions, such as distress, intrusiveness, or avoidance.
Changes in these reactions may occur without altering broader metacognitive beliefs.
We measured participants' reported reactions to specific memories, assessing changes in distress, intrusiveness, and avoidance.

**3. Distress tolerance:**
Distress tolerance has been suggested as a critical factor in the efficacy of exposure therapy, potentially more important than fear reduction itself [@craskeOptimizingInhibitoryLearning2008; @hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999].
Repeated exposure to intense, negative emotional events may enhance participants' ability to tolerate distress.
We predict that distress tolerance will increase as a result of participants’ engagement with the WET protocol.

**4. Thought fusion:**
The belief that thoughts have direct causal effects on the world, behavior, and objects—referred to as thought fusion—has been linked to intrusive thoughts and OCD as well as other anxiety disorders [@rassinThoughtactionFusionCausal1999; @rassinThoughtactionFusionThought2001; @thompson-hollandsThoughtactionFusionAnxiety2013].
Exposure to negative imagery without adverse consequences may reduce the perceived importance of thoughts, leading to improved outcomes.
We hypothesize that WET will reduce thought fusion, supporting better symptom management.

**5. Negative beliefs about images and memories:**
In addition to thought fusion, other metacognitive beliefs about images and memories can maintain distress.
These include beliefs that recalling a memory is dangerous and may lead to losing control, "going crazy," or emotional collapse.
Such beliefs about uncontrollability and danger may perpetuate avoidance and distress.
WET aims to challenge these beliefs by encouraging safe engagement with distressing memories, fostering cognitive restructuring.

This study aims to extend WET in three ways: a) applying it to a transdiagnostic population; b) exploring its utility for coping with anticipated future threats rather than past events; and c) assessing its effectiveness as a self-administered, online intervention.
Our goal is to provide individuals across a transdiagnostic range of anxiety-related disorders with tools to manage anxiety independently.
To date, WET has not been widely tested within this type of sample or setting.
Thus, our primary aim is to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing anxiety symptoms.
We hypothesized that WET will yield greater reductions in anxiety symptoms and improvements in well-being compared to both active control (written distraction imagery) and waitlist control conditions.

An additional aim is to investigate the mechanisms underlying WET’s effects, enhancing our understanding of how it facilitates therapeutic change.
More insight into mechanisms could help to fine tune theory, optimize therapeutic processes and improve outcomes [@nivPrecisionCognitiveBehavioral2021; @huppertCBTAnxietyDisorders2020].
We measured potential mechanisms that might drive WET’s effects, focusing on both threat-specific processes (e.g., fear reduction, reactions to distressing memories) and threat-agnostic processes [e.g., distress tolerance, thought fusion, and negative metacognitions regarding memories or images; @rousseauMechanismsActionUnderlying2018].

To explore these processes, we examined whether WET changes these factors and, if so, whether these changes correlate with reductions in anxiety symptoms.
We anticipate that changes in mechanisms will align with symptom changes, supporting their role in the intervention’s therapeutic process.
